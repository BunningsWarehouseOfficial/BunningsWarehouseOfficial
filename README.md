👋 Hi, I’m Kristian, Advanced Science (Honours) student of software engineering at Curtin University.

👀 I’m interested in deep learning, economic and environmental sustainability, space exploration and rocketry, longevity, investing, data from my life, and technology in general.

🌱 I’m currently learning about Svelte and microservices, among other things.

⭐ I finished my [honours thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ga3G7J4nosSUuaum6RhyoEhmde9-34tc/view) on synthetic dataset generation for traffic sign detection at the end of 2022. Here is a [digital poster presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEmSS8rvJA/ZwClY39g-0kAISAOSOYUXw/view?utm_content=DAEmSS8rvJA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton#1) summarising my 2021 work on the same project (where I had 1/5th of the time).
