👋 Hi, I’m Kristian, software engineer and Curtin University Advanced Science (Honours) graduate.

👀 I’m interested in software, economic and environmental sustainability, space exploration and rocketry, longevity, investing, data from my life, and technology in general.

⭐ I finished my [honours thesis](https://github.com/BunningsWarehouseOfficial/Synthetic-Traffic-Sign-Data) on synthetic dataset generation for traffic sign detection at the end of 2022 (although I do want to revise it and continue work on the project). Here is a [digital poster presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEmSS8rvJA/ZwClY39g-0kAISAOSOYUXw/view?utm_content=DAEmSS8rvJA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton#1) summarising my 2021 work on the same project (where I had ~1/3 of the time). During the thesis I wrote a [conference paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA56598.2022.10034587), for which the now rather out-of-date code can be found [in this repo](https://github.com/dsphamgithub/tsda).
